# water\_level

This command does not require the system be placed in calibration mode.



To use the `water_level` command, go to the serial monitor to use the command line and type `water_level`.



This will return the distance, in centimeters, between the ultrasonic sensor and the water level. The ideal setpoint is 8cm, the soft maximum is 5cm.
