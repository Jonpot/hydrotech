# fix\_water

This command does not require the system be placed in calibration mode.



To use the `fix_water` command, go to the serial monitor to use the command line and type `` `fix_water` ``.



This will turn the water pump on until the ideal setpoint of 8cm between the ultrasonic sensor and the water level is reached.
