# set

This command does not require the system be placed in calibration mode.



To use the `set` command, go to the serial monitor to use the command line and type `set`, followed by the pump (`A`-`H`) you would like to target and the state (`on` or `off`) you'd like to set the pump to, such as `set A on`.



This will turn the specified pump on off, accordingly.
